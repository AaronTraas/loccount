= README for loccount =

loccount is a re-implementation of David A. Wheeler's sloccount tool
in Go.  It is faster and handles more different languages. Because
it's one source file in Go, it is easier to maintain and extend than the
multi-file, multi-language implemention of the original.

The algorithms are largely unchanged and can be expected to produce
identical numbers for languages supported by both tools.

You can run a self-test with 'make check'.  The sample sources are in
the test/ subdirectory.
